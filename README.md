# Supervised, Semi-Supervised, and Unsupervised Learning on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set

In this project , I have studied various methods for classification of data on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set .  <br>

The methods are listed below: <br>
1) <b> Supervised Learning </b> - Used an L-1 penalized SVM  <br>
2) <b>Semi-Supervised Learning/ Self-training </b>: Randomly selected 50% of the positive class along with 50% of the negative classalong with 50% of the negative class. <br>
--Used an L-1 penalized SVM for classification <br>
3) <b> Unsupervised Learning </b>: Using k-means algorithm <br>
4) <b>Unsupervised Learning </b>: Using <b>Spectral Clustering </b> algorithm   <br>

Diagnostic Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database

The data is downloaded from : 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29

Attribute Information: <br>

1) ID number <br>
2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)<br>
Ten real-valued features are used for each cell nucleus.<br>
